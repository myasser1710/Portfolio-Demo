## Developer Achievements & Technical Highlights

- **Semantic, Mobile‑First Layout**  
  Constructed using semantic HTML5 and a mobile‑first CSS approach, this project ensures optimal performance across a wide range of devices and screen sizes, with a clear, accessible codebase.

- **Modular Architecture & Section Abstraction**  
  Structured content into independent, self‑contained sections (Hero, About, Services, Portfolio, Testimonials, Counters, Team, Contact) to facilitate easy modification and reusability.

- **Interactive Navigation & Scroll Behavior**  
  Crafted a sticky navigation menu that intelligently highlights the active section. Smooth scrolling implemented via vanilla JavaScript provides seamless transitions and improved user flow.

- **Client‑Side Portfolio Filtering**  
  Enabled dynamic filtering of portfolio items by category—allowing users to toggle between "All," "Brand," "Design," and "Graphic" without page reloads or external libraries.

- **Animated Counters for Visual Engagement**  
  Developed a custom `counter.js` script that animates stats as users scroll into view, enhancing engagement with minimal impact on performance.

- **Performance & Load Optimization**  
  Optimized image assets, implemented lazy loading patterns, reduced unused CSS/JS payloads, and ensured minimal reflows—resulting in swift page loads and efficient deliverables.

- **Accessibility & SEO Integration**  
  Employed alt text for visuals, meaningful ARIA roles, logical heading structure, and descriptive link text. This ensures keyboard navigability and search engine friendliness.

- **Scalable Deployment via GitHub Pages**  
  Leveraged GitHub Pages for hosting, enabling zero‑configuration, reliable, and globally available delivery with no backend dependencies.

- **Theming Options** – Add a dark/light mode toggle for better user customization.
- **Build Optimization Pipeline** – Introduce tools (like Vite or Parcel) for asset bundling, CSS/JS minification, and automatic cache busting.
- **Asset Management** – Remove archived files (e.g., `Daniels.rar`) and replace them with properly versioned assets or release artifacts.
- **Accessibility Checks & CI** – Integrate accessibility and link validation tests (e.g., Lighthouse CI) within a GitHub Actions workflow.

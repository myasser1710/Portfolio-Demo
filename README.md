## Project Structure

```
.
├─ css/             # Stylesheets (core styles and vendor CSS)
├─ fonts/           # Local font files (if any)
├─ images/          # Images used across the site (portfolio, team, etc.)
├─ webfonts/        # Icon fonts (e.g., Font Awesome) if used
├─ counter.js       # Counter / fun-facts logic
├─ nav.js           # Navigation-related behavior (e.g., sticky / active states)
├─ index.html       # Single entry HTML file
└─ Daniels.rar      # Archived template/assets (recommended to remove from version control)
```

If you don’t need the archived file, delete `Daniels.rar` to keep the repository lean.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
No special tooling is required. Any modern browser will run the site locally from the `index.html` file.

### Quick Start
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/myasser1710/Portfolio-Demo.git
   cd Portfolio-Demo
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

---

## Local Development

Serving the site with an HTTP server avoids CORS issues and enables better dev tooling.

- **Option 1 – VS Code Live Server**  
  Install the *Live Server* extension and click “Go Live” from VS Code’s status bar.

- **Option 2 – Python HTTP server**  
  ```bash
  # Python 3
  python -m http.server 5173
  # then open http://localhost:5173
  ```

---

## Deployment (GitHub Pages)

1. Commit and push changes to `master` (or `main`).
2. Go to **Settings → Pages**.
3. Under **Build and deployment**, choose **Deploy from a branch** and select the root of `master` (or `main`).
4. Save. Your site is published at:
   ```
   https://<your-username>.github.io/Portfolio-Demo/
   ```

The `index.html` at the repository root is used as the entry point.

---

## Customization Guide

- **Branding / Hero**: Edit the heading/subheading and social links in the Hero section of `index.html`.
- **About / Skills**: Update bio text and progress values. Consider using `<meter>` or ARIA attributes for accessible progress indicators.
- **Services**: Replace icons/titles/blurbs in the Services section.
- **Portfolio**: Swap images in `images/` and update categories. If using a filter plugin, ensure the item categories (e.g., `data-filter` / class names) match.
- **Testimonials**: Replace avatars, names, and quotes.
- **Team**: Update member images, names, roles, and links.
- **Contact**: Replace placeholder addresses and wire the form to a service (e.g., Formspree, Netlify Forms) if you need submissions.
- **Colors & Typography**: Edit variables or root styles in `css/`. If Bootstrap is included, you can override variables via a custom stylesheet loaded after vendor CSS.

---

## Accessibility & SEO Notes

- Use **meaningful alt text** for images in `images/`.
- Ensure **color contrast** meets WCAG 2.1 AA.
- Add **`lang` attribute** on `<html>` and descriptive **page title** and **meta description** in `<head>`.
- Provide **keyboard focus styles** and verify tab order through all interactive elements.
- If using carousels, ensure **pause/stop controls** and that content is reachable with the keyboard.
- Add **Open Graph / Twitter Card** meta tags for rich link previews.

---

## Performance Tips

- Compress and optimize images in `images/` (WebP/AVIF where possible).
- Minify CSS/JS for production (e.g., via a simple pre‑commit step or an online minifier).
- Use `loading="lazy"` on non‑critical images.
- Defer non‑essential scripts with `defer`/`async` and place them near the end of `body`.
- Remove unused fonts and icon sets from `webfonts/` to reduce payload.
- Consider a build step later (Vite/Parcel) if you want automated minification and cache‑busting.

---

## Known Limitations

- **Static Only**: No backend or API integration.
- **Form Handling**: Contact form does not submit anywhere by default.
- **Archived Assets**: `Daniels.rar` is included; consider removing binaries from version control or adding them as a GitHub Release asset instead.

---

## Roadmap

- Replace archived binaries with clean, versioned assets.
- Consolidate vendor CSS/JS under a `vendor/` folder with clear attribution.
- Optional: migrate to **Bootstrap 5** (if not already) and remove jQuery dependencies.
- Optional: add a lightweight bundler (Vite) for minification and cache‑busting.
- Add **CI** (GitHub Actions) to run a11y checks (e.g., Lighthouse CI) and link checker on PRs.
- Add **Netlify/Vercel** preview deployments for branches.

---

## License & Credits

- **License**: No explicit license file is present in this repository at the time of writing. If you intend others to reuse this template, add a `LICENSE` file (MIT is common for simple templates).
- **Credits**: Image assets and icon fonts should be used under their respective licenses. If this template derives from a third‑party “Daniels” portfolio design, please include proper attribution and respect the original license.
